# Modal Windows 

## Description 

Focussing on the interactivity aspect of webpages through modal windows, which are elements that are present on almost every single webpage of websites including twitter and facebook, this webpage contains three main windows that can be clicked on one at a time. Upon this action, the window gets highlighted as an overlay, as a result of which the background is made to be dimmer. 

Each modal window contains a heading and a paragraph of text. Each window can then be closed by the user, following which the overlay effect will be removed, and all three buttons to open the windows will be displayed again.
